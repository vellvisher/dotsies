If there is text selection, uses the text selection for path.
If the path starts with “http://”, open the URL in browser.
Input path can be {relative, full path, URL}.
Path may have a trailing “:‹n›” that indicates line number.
If so, jump to that line number.
If path does not have a file extention, automatically try with “.el” for elisp
files.
This command is similar to `find-file-at-point' but without prompting for
confirmation.
